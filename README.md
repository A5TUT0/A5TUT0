## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’ve been working on. They reflect my curiosity, my willingness to learn, and my current skill set. Each one has helped me gain more experience and a deeper understanding of development.

### 🌐 [Online Shop](https://github.com/A5TUT0/OnlineShop)

**Description:** This project is an online store where users can manage categories and products. I developed this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and an API with Express.js for the backend. It was a great way to learn about user authentication, building a basic API, and frontend design using Tailwind CSS.

**Tech Stack:** Tailwind, HTML, JavaScript, Figma

Working on this project taught me a lot about desktop application development and accessibility principles.
